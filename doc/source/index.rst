=======================
OpenStack CodeGenerator
=======================

Primary goal of the project is to simplify maintainers life by generating
complete or at least parts of the code.

It is currently in a phase of finding final structure there currently is not
an official OpenStack project (to allow subprojects split or merge). Once the
structure stabilizes a request to include this as official project would be
made.
